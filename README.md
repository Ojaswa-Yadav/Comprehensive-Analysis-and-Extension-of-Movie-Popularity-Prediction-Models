# Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Extension-of-Movie-Popularity-Prediction-Models

Our analysis utilizes the CSM (Conventional and Social Media Movies) Dataset for the years 2014 and 2015. This dataset, curated by Mehreen Ahmed in 2017, is a comprehensive collection of movie-related data that combines conventional movie attributes with social media metrics.

The dataset comprises information sourced from IMDb, Wikipedia, YouTube, and Twitter, alongside sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion. This project employs various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree based models, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
